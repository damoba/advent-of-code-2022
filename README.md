# Advent of Code 2022
My solutions to the following problems: https://adventofcode.com/2022
## Coded in TypeScript on a Deno environment
To run:
- Install Deno.
- If you are on VS Code, install the Deno extension.
- Navigate to a particular day's folder on your terminal.
- To run a specific part's solution (e.g. p1.ts) and watch for any file changes:
```
deno test --allow-read --watch --allow-hrtime p1.ts
```
